# insurance-management-plaform

An insurance management platform API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of programming instructions and standards that allow different software systems to communicate and exchange data with each other. In the context of an insurance management platform, an API allows other software systems to access the platform's functionality and data.

For example, an insurance company may have its own customer-facing website or mobile app that allows customers to purchase policies and file claims. By using the insurance management platform API, the company can integrate its website or app with the platform's backend systems, enabling customers to access policy information, file claims, and perform other tasks.
